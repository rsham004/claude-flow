# Software Development Course Template

## Overview
This is a comprehensive template for creating high-quality software development courses. The template provides a structured approach to course design with built-in quality assurance measures.

## Current Status
⚠️ **Template Structure Complete - Content Development Required**

The course framework is established but requires content development to be fully functional.

## Structure

### Course Modules
- **01-fundamentals/**: Core programming concepts and basics
- **02-intermediate/**: Advanced language features and patterns
- **03-advanced/**: Complex systems and architecture
- **04-expert/**: Specialization and advanced topics

### Supporting Components
- **assessments/**: Evaluation tools and rubrics
- **common/**: Shared resources and utilities
- **templates/**: Content creation templates
- **tools/**: Development and testing utilities

## Quality Assurance

### Documentation
- [Validation Report](./validation-report.md) - Current quality assessment
- [Quality Framework](./quality-framework.md) - Standards and guidelines
- [Complete Module Example](./templates/complete-module-example.md) - Reference implementation

### Quality Standards
- ✅ Well-structured directory organization
- ❌ Content development required
- ❌ Code examples need implementation
- ❌ Exercises and assessments pending
- ❌ Documentation needs completion
