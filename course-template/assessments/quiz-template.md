**Explanation**: [Brief explanation of why the statement is true or false]

#### Question 6 (X points)
**Statement**: In object-oriented programming, inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.

**Answer**: T
**Explanation**: This is the fundamental concept of inheritance in OOP.

**Explanation**: Functions are reusable code blocks that can accept parameters.

#### Question 9 (X points)

**Answers**: encapsulation, polymorphism
**Explanation**: These are two fundamental OOP principles.

### Section D: Short Answer (XX points)

**Instructions**: Provide brief, clear answers to the following questions. Each question is worth [X] points.

#### Question 10 (X points)
Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument in function calls.

**Sample Answer**: 
A parameter is a variable defined in the function declaration that acts as a placeholder for values. An argument is the actual value passed to the function when it's called. For example, in `function greet(name)`, `name` is a parameter, and in `greet("Alice")`, `"Alice"` is an argument.

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points: Clearly distinguishes parameters from arguments with examples
- Partial points: Explains one concept correctly but confuses the other
- No points: Incorrect or no explanation

#### Question 11 (X points)
What are the advantages of using loops instead of writing repetitive code?

**Sample Answer**:
Loops provide several advantages: 1) Reduce code duplication and improve maintainability, 2) Make code more flexible by allowing dynamic repetition based on conditions, 3) Reduce the chance of errors from copy-paste mistakes, 4) Make code more readable and concise.

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points: Mentions 3+ advantages with clear explanations
- Partial points: Mentions 1-2 advantages correctly
- No points: Incorrect or vague explanations

### Section E: Code Analysis (XX points)

**Instructions**: Analyze the given code and answer the questions. Each question is worth [X] points.

#### Question 12 (X points)
Examine the following code and identify any errors or issues:

```[language]
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }
    return sum / numbers.length;
}
```

**Issues to identify**:
1. Off-by-one error: loop condition should be `i < numbers.length`
2. No input validation (what if numbers is empty or null?)
3. No error handling for non-numeric values

**Sample Answer**:
The main issue is in the loop condition `i <= numbers.length` which will cause an index out of bounds error. It should be `i < numbers.length`. Additionally, the function doesn't handle edge cases like empty arrays or null input.

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points: Identifies the main error and mentions edge cases
- Partial points: Identifies the main error only
- No points: Doesn't identify the main error

#### Question 13 (X points)
What will this code print? Trace through the execution step by step.

```[language]
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

function swap(a, b) {
    let temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    console.log(`Inside function: a=${a}, b=${b}`);
}

swap(x, y);
console.log(`Outside function: x=${x}, y=${y}`);
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Inside function: a=5, b=10
Outside function: x=10, y=5
```

**Explanation**: The function parameters are passed by value, so changes inside the function don't affect the original variables.

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points: Correct output and explanation of pass-by-value
- Partial points: Correct output but incomplete explanation
- No points: Incorrect output

### Section F: Problem Solving (XX points)

**Instructions**: Solve the following programming problems. Show your work and reasoning.

#### Question 14 (X points)
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the second largest number. Handle edge cases appropriately.

**Sample Solution**:
```javascript
function findSecondLargest(numbers) {
    // Input validation
    if (!Array.isArray(numbers) || numbers.length < 2) {
        return null; // or throw an error
    }
    
    // Remove duplicates and sort
    const uniqueNumbers = [...new Set(numbers)].sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Check if we have at least 2 unique numbers
    return uniqueNumbers.length >= 2 ? uniqueNumbers[1] : null;
}
```

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points (X points): Correct logic, handles edge cases, clean code
- Good (X-2 points): Correct logic, minor issues with edge cases
- Partial (X/2 points): Basic logic correct but significant issues
- No points: Incorrect logic or doesn't work

#### Question 15 (X points)
Describe the steps you would take to debug a program that's not producing the expected output.

**Sample Answer**:
1. **Understand the problem**: Re-read requirements and expected behavior
2. **Identify the issue**: Compare actual output with expected output
3. **Check inputs**: Verify that input data is correct and in expected format
4. **Use debugging tools**: Set breakpoints, use console.log, or step through code
5. **Trace program flow**: Follow the execution path step by step
6. **Check logic**: Verify that conditions, loops, and calculations are correct
7. **Test with simple cases**: Use minimal test data to isolate the problem
8. **Review recent changes**: If it worked before, check what changed
9. **Seek help**: Ask colleagues or search documentation/forums
10. **Document the fix**: Record what caused the issue and how it was resolved

**Grading Criteria**:
- Full points: Mentions systematic approach with 5+ specific steps
- Partial points: Mentions some debugging techniques but lacks systematic approach
- No points: Vague or incorrect debugging approach
