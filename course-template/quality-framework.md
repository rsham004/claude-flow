    └── additional-reading.md
```

### 2. Code Quality Standards

#### Code Example Requirements
- **Functional**: All code must execute without errors
- **Documented**: Clear comments explaining key concepts
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards and conventions
- **Progressive**: Complexity increases appropriately
- **Platform-agnostic**: Works across different environments

#### Testing Protocol for Code Examples
```javascript
// Example testing framework for course code
describe('Course Code Examples', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  it('should execute without errors', () => {
    expect(() => exampleFunction()).not.toThrow();
  });

  it('should produce expected output', () => {
    const result = exampleFunction();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should follow best practices', () => {
    // Code quality checks
    expect(codeQualityCheck(exampleCode)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### 3. Exercise Design Principles

  - Portfolio development
  - Final capstone project

Authentic Assessments:
  - Real-world problem solving
  - Industry-standard practices
  - Collaborative projects
  - Open-source contributions
```

#### Rubric Development Standards
```
Performance Levels:
  Expert (4): Exceeds expectations, demonstrates mastery
  Proficient (3): Meets expectations, solid understanding
  Developing (2): Partial understanding, needs improvement
  Novice (1): Limited understanding, requires significant support

Assessment Criteria:
  - Technical accuracy (25%)
  - Code quality and style (25%)
  - Problem-solving approach (25%)
  - Documentation and communication (25%)
```

### 5. Content Review Process

#### Multi-Stage Review System
1. **Technical Review**: Code functionality and accuracy
2. **Pedagogical Review**: Learning effectiveness and progression
3. **Accessibility Review**: Inclusive design and universal access
4. **Industry Review**: Current relevance and best practices

#### Quality Gates
```
Gate 1 - Content Creation:
✓ Learning objectives defined
✓ Content outline approved
✓ Prerequisites identified

Gate 2 - Development:
✓ All content created

- **Completion Rates**: Module and course completion percentages
- **Learning Outcomes**: Assessment score distributions
- **Engagement Metrics**: Time spent, resource utilization
- **Satisfaction Scores**: Student feedback and ratings
- **Career Impact**: Job placement and advancement rates

#### Feedback Integration Process
