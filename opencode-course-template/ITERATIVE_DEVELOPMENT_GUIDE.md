# OpenCode.ai Course - Iterative Development Guide

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

This guide outlines the **incremental, review-as-we-go approach** for developing course materials that are strictly aligned with **COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md** for experienced programmers learning OpenCode.ai mastery.

---

## 📋 Development Principles

### **1. Requirements-First Development**
- Every piece of content must directly serve COURSE_REQUIREMENTS.md objectives
- Target audience: **Experienced programmers (2+ years minimum)**
- Focus: **Professional productivity enhancement**, not basic education
- Validation: Each component tested against success criteria

### **2. Incremental Content Creation**
- Develop one module completely before starting the next
- Create lesson → review → iterate → validate → move forward
- Continuous alignment checking with course requirements
- Real-world testing with target audience (experienced developers)

### **3. Professional Development Focus**
- **No gamification** - experienced developers want efficiency
- **No basic tutorials** - assume professional competence
- **Real codebases** - use actual projects (1000+ lines minimum)
- **Measurable outcomes** - productivity improvements, not completion badges

- [ ] Improve measurable outcome clarity

#### Step 8: Validation Testing
- [ ] Test with representative target audience member
- [ ] Measure learning outcome achievement
- [ ] Validate time estimates for experienced developers
- [ ] Confirm professional applicability

### **Phase 4: Module Completion**

#### Step 9: Remaining Lessons
- [ ] Apply refined approach to remaining module lessons
- [ ] Maintain consistency with established quality standards
- [ ] Ensure progressive skill building appropriate for professionals
- [ ] Validate cumulative module objectives achievement

#### Step 10: Module Assessment
- [ ] Create comprehensive module assessment
- [ ] Align with 70% practical / 30% knowledge requirement
- [ ] Design for experienced developer skill demonstration
- [ ] Include measurable productivity improvement validation
