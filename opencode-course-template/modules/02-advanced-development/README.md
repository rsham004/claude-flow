# Module 2: Advanced AI-Assisted Development

## üìã Module Overview

**Duration**: 3 weeks, 30 hours total  
**Prerequisites**: Module 1 completed - working OpenCode.ai with multi-provider setup  
**Target**: Master Plan and Build modes for complex development tasks  
**Objective**: Transform from basic AI usage to sophisticated development workflows

## üîÑ Module 1 Refresher & Validation

### **Quick Skills Check (15 minutes)**

Before diving into advanced techniques, verify your Module 1 foundations:

```bash
# Test 1: Multi-provider setup working
opencode
/provider openai
/ask "Hello, confirm you're working"
/provider anthropic  
/ask "Hello, confirm you're working"

# Test 2: Can analyze real codebase quickly
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi.git
cd fastapi
opencode
/init
/ask "What are the 3 main architectural components of this codebase?"
```

**Success Criteria**: Both providers respond correctly, you can identify FastAPI's main components (FastAPI class, routing system, dependency injection) within 5 minutes.

### **Module 1 Skills Checkpoint**
