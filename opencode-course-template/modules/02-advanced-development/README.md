# Module 2: Advanced AI-Assisted Development

## üìã Module Overview

**Duration**: 3 weeks, 30 hours total  
**Prerequisites**: Module 1 completed - working OpenCode.ai with multi-provider setup  
**Target**: Master Build mode and advanced techniques for complex development tasks  
**Objective**: Transform from basic AI usage to sophisticated development workflows

## üö® **Critical: Build Mode Usage for Advanced Developers**

**This module teaches Build mode exclusively** because:
- ‚úÖ **Build mode allows file editing and creation** - essential for real development
- ‚úÖ **Full tool access** - can read, write, modify, and execute code
- ‚úÖ **Professional workflow** - matches how developers actually work
- ‚ùå **Plan mode is read-only** - cannot create or modify files (not suitable for coding)

**Key Understanding**: Advanced developers need to create and modify files, so Build mode is the only practical choice for professional development.

## üîÑ Module 1 Refresher & Validation

### **Quick Skills Check (15 minutes)**

Before diving into advanced techniques, verify your Module 1 foundations:

```bash
# Test 1: Multi-provider setup working
opencode
/provider openai
/ask "Hello, confirm you're working"
/provider anthropic  
/ask "Hello, confirm you're working"

# Test 2: Can analyze real codebase quickly
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi.git
cd fastapi
opencode
/init
/ask "What are the 3 main architectural components of this codebase?"
```

**Success Criteria**: Both providers respond correctly, you can identify FastAPI's main components (FastAPI class, routing system, dependency injection) within 5 minutes.

### **Module 1 Skills Checkpoint**

You should now have:
- ‚úÖ **Working multi-provider setup**: OpenAI + Anthropic minimum
- ‚úÖ **Cost monitoring**: Usage tracking and limits configured
- ‚úÖ **Codebase analysis skills**: Can navigate and understand 1000+ line projects
- ‚úÖ **Real project experience**: Built working REST API with tests
- ‚úÖ **Security awareness**: API keys properly secured

**If any item is missing**, review Module 1 materials before proceeding.
