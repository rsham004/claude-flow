### Initialize OpenCode.ai
```bash
opencode
/init
```

## üìù Exercise Tasks

### Phase 1: Monolith Analysis (90 minutes)

#### Task 1.1: Architecture Discovery
Use Plan mode to analyze your chosen application:

```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Analyze [your chosen application] to understand its current monolithic architecture:

1. **Business Domain Identification**: What are the main business capabilities?
2. **Data Model Analysis**: Core entities and their relationships
3. **Service Boundaries**: Natural divisions in functionality
4. **Integration Points**: External systems and dependencies
5. **Technical Architecture**: Frameworks, databases, caching, etc.

Focus on understanding the business logic and data flow patterns.
```

**Deliverable**: 2-page architecture analysis document

#### Task 1.2: Identify Microservice Candidates
```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Based on the architecture analysis, identify potential microservices using Domain-Driven Design principles:

For each proposed microservice:
1. **Bounded Context**: Clear business domain boundary
2. **Data Ownership**: What data models it would own
3. **API Surface**: What operations it would expose
4. **Dependencies**: What it needs from other services
5. **Size Estimation**: Approximate lines of code

Recommend 5-8 microservices maximum for realistic migration.
```

**Deliverable**: Microservices candidate list with rationale

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy Planning (120 minutes)

#### Task 2.1: Service Extraction Strategy
```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Create a detailed migration strategy for extracting microservices from [your application]:

1. **Migration Sequence**: Order of service extraction with rationale
2. **Data Migration Approach**: How to handle data separation
3. **API Design Strategy**: How services will communicate
4. **Deployment Strategy**: How to deploy new services alongside monolith
5. **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if migration fails

Consider the "Strangler Fig" pattern for gradual migration.
```

**Deliverable**: Step-by-step migration plan

#### Task 2.2: Technical Implementation Planning
```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Design the technical implementation approach for the microservices migration:

1. **Communication Patterns**: REST APIs, event-driven architecture, etc.
2. **Data Consistency**: How to maintain consistency across services
3. **Service Discovery**: How services find and communicate with each other
4. **Monitoring & Observability**: How to monitor the distributed system
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to test microservices in isolation and integration

Base recommendations on the specific technology stack of your chosen application.
```

**Deliverable**: Technical implementation specification

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment & Mitigation (60 minutes)

#### Task 3.1: Risk Analysis
```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Conduct comprehensive risk assessment for the microservices migration:

**Technical Risks**:
- Data consistency challenges
- Network latency and reliability
- Increased operational complexity
- Performance degradation

**Business Risks**:
- Migration timeline overruns
- Feature development slowdown during migration
- Potential system downtime
- Team learning curve

For each risk:
1. **Probability** (1-5 scale)
2. **Impact** (1-5 scale) 
3. **Mitigation Strategy**
4. **Early Warning Signs**
5. **Contingency Plan**
```

**Deliverable**: Risk register with mitigation strategies

### Phase 4: Professional Documentation (90 minutes)

#### Task 4.1: Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Create ADRs for major architectural decisions:

```
Architecture Decision Record: Service Communication Pattern

## Status
Proposed

## Context
[Describe the situation requiring the decision]

## Decision
[State the decision made]

## Consequences
[Describe positive and negative consequences]
```

Create ADRs for:
1. Service decomposition strategy
2. Inter-service communication pattern
3. Data consistency approach
4. Deployment and orchestration strategy

#### Task 4.2: Executive Summary
```
# Using Build mode to create documentation and architecture files

Create an executive summary for leadership that includes:

1. **Business Justification**: Why migrate to microservices?
2. **High-Level Approach**: What's the migration strategy?
3. **Timeline & Resources**: How long and what team size?
4. **Risks & Mitigation**: What could go wrong and how to prevent it?
5. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?
6. **Investment Required**: Development resources, infrastructure, training

Make this suitable for non-technical stakeholders while being specific about technical approaches.
```

**Deliverable**: 2-page executive summary
