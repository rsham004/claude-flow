## üìù Exercise Tasks

### Phase 1: Legacy Code Analysis (75 minutes)

#### Task 1.1: Establish Context Layers
Use advanced prompting to establish comprehensive project context:

```
I'm modernizing a legacy [your chosen application] codebase. Help me establish layered context for this complex modernization project:

**Context Layer 1 - Legacy Assessment**:
- Current technology stack and versions
- Deprecated patterns and anti-patterns in the code
- Security vulnerabilities from outdated practices
- Performance bottlenecks from legacy approaches

**Context Layer 2 - Modernization Targets**:
- Target technology versions (language, frameworks, libraries)
- Modern patterns to adopt (async/await, dependency injection, etc.)
- Security improvements to implement
- Performance optimizations to apply

**Context Layer 3 - Migration Strategy**:
- Risk assessment for each type of change
- Order of modernization (low-risk to high-risk changes)
- Testing strategy for validating modernization
- Rollback plan if modernization introduces issues

This will be my reference context for all subsequent modernization work.
```

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive legacy assessment document

#### Task 1.2: Identify Modernization Priorities
```
# Using Build mode to create implementation and documentation files

Based on the legacy assessment, prioritize modernization tasks:

**High Priority (Critical for security/functionality)**:
- Security vulnerabilities that must be fixed
- Deprecated language features that will break
- Critical performance bottlenecks

**Medium Priority (Improves maintainability)**:
- Code structure and organization improvements
- Error handling and logging enhancements
- Testing and validation improvements

**Low Priority (Nice-to-have improvements)**:
- Code style and formatting updates
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations

For each priority level, provide:
1. Specific tasks with file locations
2. Estimated effort and complexity
3. Dependencies between tasks
4. Testing requirements
```

**Deliverable**: Prioritized modernization backlog

### Phase 2: Systematic Modernization (180 minutes)

#### Task 2.1: Foundation Modernization (High Priority)
Use Build mode with spiral development pattern:

```
/mode build

Using our established context layers, implement foundation modernization:

**Spiral 1 - Critical Security Fixes** (implement now):
- Update deprecated security-related functions
- Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Update authentication/authorization patterns
- Add input validation where missing

**Spiral 2 - Language Modernization** (plan for next iteration):
- Update to modern language syntax
- Replace deprecated functions with modern equivalents
- Update error handling patterns
- Modernize configuration management

**Spiral 3 - Architecture Improvements** (plan for future):
- Implement dependency injection
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Improve code organization
- Add comprehensive testing

Implement Spiral 1 completely, ensuring each change maintains backward compatibility where possible. Include detailed comments explaining modernization decisions.
```

**Deliverable**: Modernized foundation code with security improvements

#### Task 2.2: Progressive Enhancement (Medium Priority)
```
/mode build

Continue with Spiral 2 - Language Modernization, building on the foundation changes:

**Language Syntax Updates**:
- Convert old syntax to modern equivalents
- Update function signatures and type hints

- Add error monitoring and alerting hooks

**Configuration Management**:
- Move configuration from hardcoded values to config files
- Add environment-specific configuration support
- Implement secure credential management
- Add configuration validation

While implementing, maintain context from Spiral 1 and explain how each change builds on previous modernization work.
```

**Deliverable**: Language-modernized codebase with improved error handling

#### Task 2.3: Advanced Modernization (Low Priority)
