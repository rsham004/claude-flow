## üö® **Critical: Build Mode for Professional Development**

This course teaches **Build mode as the default** because:
- ‚úÖ **Build mode allows file editing** - essential for real development work
- ‚úÖ **Full tool access** - can create, modify, and execute code
- ‚úÖ **Professional workflow** - matches how developers actually work
- ‚ùå **Plan mode is read-only** - cannot edit files (not suitable for coding)

**Key Point**: Advanced developers need to create and modify files, so Build mode is the only practical choice for professional development.

**Course Philosophy**: No theory. No fluff. Just real code, real prompts, and real results.
