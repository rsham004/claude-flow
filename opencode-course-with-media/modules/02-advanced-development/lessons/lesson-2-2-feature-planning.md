# Lesson 2.2: Feature Planning & Requirements Analysis

## üéØ What You'll Actually Do

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Transform business requirements into technical specifications using Build mode with file creation
- Break down complex features and generate implementation templates with AI assistance
- Practice requirements analysis on real open-source project feature requests
- Create professional technical specifications and documentation files that development teams can execute

## üö® **Build Mode for Feature Planning**

**Use Build mode for feature planning** because:
- ‚úÖ **Creates specification documents** - generates actual deliverable files
- ‚úÖ **Produces code templates** - provides implementation starting points
- ‚úÖ **Generates documentation** - creates team-shareable specifications
- ‚ùå **Plan mode only provides suggestions** - cannot create the files teams need

## üîÑ Skills Bridge from Lesson 2.1

**Previous**: You planned complete system architectures with generated documentation files.
**Now**: You'll focus on individual feature planning with specification and template creation.
**Next**: Lesson 2.3 will implement the features using the specifications and templates you create.

## üéØ Real Project: GitHub Feature Request Analysis

We'll work with **Shopify's Liquid template engine** - analyzing real GitHub issues and feature requests.

### Setup the Real Codebase

```bash
# Clone Shopify Liquid (real templating engine)
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/liquid.git
cd liquid

# Examine real feature requests
# Browse: https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues

# Initialize OpenCode.ai for feature planning
opencode
/init
```

**Why Shopify Liquid?**
- 15,000+ lines of Ruby template engine code
- Active open-source project with real feature requests
- Complex business logic (e-commerce templating)
- Real GitHub issues with actual user requirements

## üìù Hands-On Exercise 1: Business Requirements Analysis

### Step 1: Analyze Real Feature Requests

#### Prompt 1: Extract Requirements from GitHub Issues
```
Analyze these real GitHub issues from Shopify Liquid and extract the technical requirements:

Issue #1: "Add support for nested loops with different iteration variables"
- User story: Template authors want to iterate over products while iterating over collections
- Current limitation: Variable conflicts in nested {% for %} loops
- Expected behavior: Independent iteration variables

Issue #2: "Implement lazy loading for template includes"  
- User story: Large templates with many {% include %} statements load slowly
- Current limitation: All includes are loaded immediately
- Expected behavior: Load includes only when rendered

For each issue, identify:
1. Core functional requirements
2. Performance implications
3. Backward compatibility concerns
4. Edge cases and error scenarios
5. Integration points with existing features
```

**Expected Output**: Structured requirements breakdown with technical implications.

#### Prompt 2: Prioritize and Scope Features
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

Based on the Liquid template engine codebase analysis, help me prioritize these feature requests for implementation:

1. Nested loop variable isolation
2. Lazy loading for includes
3. Template caching improvements
4. New filter functions (date manipulation)
5. Security enhancements for user-generated templates

For each feature:
- Estimate implementation complexity (1-10 scale)
- Identify dependencies on other features or systems
- Assess impact on existing functionality
- Recommend implementation order with justification

Create a development roadmap for the next 6 months.
```

**Expected Output**: Prioritized feature roadmap with implementation strategy.

### Step 2: Deep Dive Feature Analysis

#### Prompt 3: Technical Specification Creation
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

Focus on the "nested loops with different iteration variables" feature for Shopify Liquid. Create a complete technical specification:

## Functional Requirements
- Detailed behavior specification
- Input/output examples
- Edge case handling

## Technical Design
- Implementation approach in Ruby
- Data structure modifications needed
- Parser and lexer changes required

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test scenarios
- Integration test requirements
- Performance test considerations

## Implementation Plan
- Step-by-step development tasks
- Estimated effort for each task
- Risk assessment and mitigation

Base this on actual Liquid template engine architecture.
```

**Expected Output**: Complete technical specification ready for development team.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Exercise 2: API Feature Planning

### Real Feature: Add GraphQL Support to Express.js

#### Prompt 4: Requirements Gathering
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

I need to add comprehensive GraphQL support to an Express.js application. The requirements are:

Business Goals:

5. Testing and validation approach
```

#### Prompt 5: Break Down Implementation Tasks
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

Break down the Express.js GraphQL integration into specific, implementable tasks. For each task provide:

1. **Task Description**: What needs to be built
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to know it's complete
3. **Dependencies**: What must be done first
4. **Estimated Effort**: Hours to complete
5. **Implementation Notes**: Key technical considerations

Organize tasks into these categories:
- **Foundation Setup** (GraphQL server, schema basics)
- **Data Layer Integration** (resolvers, database queries)
- **Authentication & Authorization** (security integration)
- **Advanced Features** (subscriptions, file uploads)
- **Testing & Documentation** (comprehensive validation)

Make this detailed enough for a development team to execute.
```

**Expected Output**: Complete task breakdown suitable for project management tools.

## üéØ Hands-On Exercise 3: Legacy System Feature Planning

### Real Scenario: Add Modern Features to Legacy System

```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

Analyze this real legacy system scenario:

**Context**: WordPress plugin with 50,000+ active installations
**Current State**: PHP 7.4, jQuery 2.x, MySQL 5.7
**Business Requirement**: Add modern React-based admin dashboard
**Constraints**: 
- Cannot break existing PHP admin panels
- Must work with WordPress 5.0+ and 6.0+
- Plugin must remain backward compatible
- No changes to database schema allowed

Plan the feature implementation:

1. **Integration Strategy**: How React coexists with PHP admin
2. **State Management**: Sharing data between React and PHP
3. **Authentication**: WordPress user integration
4. **Build Process**: Packaging React with WordPress plugin
5. **Rollout Strategy**: Gradual migration approach

Reference real WordPress plugin architecture patterns.
```

#### Prompt 7: Risk Assessment and Mitigation
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

For the WordPress React dashboard integration, identify and plan mitigation for these risks:

**Technical Risks**:
- WordPress version compatibility issues
- Plugin conflicts with other installed plugins  
- Performance impact on older hosting environments
- SEO impact from client-side rendering

**Business Risks**:
- User confusion from mixed UI paradigms
- Increased support burden during transition
- Potential customer churn from breaking changes

For each risk:
1. **Probability**: How likely is this to occur? (1-5 scale)
2. **Impact**: How severe would the consequences be? (1-5 scale)
3. **Detection**: How would we know this happened?
4. **Mitigation**: Specific steps to prevent or minimize
5. **Contingency**: What to do if mitigation fails

Create a risk register suitable for project stakeholders.
```

## üéØ Advanced Feature Planning Techniques

### Complex Feature Decomposition

#### Prompt 10: Multi-System Feature Planning
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

Plan a complex feature that spans multiple systems:

**Feature**: "Smart content recommendations in a blogging platform"
**Systems Involved**:
- Content management system (Django)
- Machine learning service (Python/TensorFlow)  
- Real-time analytics (Node.js/Redis)
- CDN and caching layer
- Mobile app API integration

For this multi-system feature:

1. **Service Boundaries**: What each system is responsible for
2. **Data Flow**: How information moves between systems
3. **API Contracts**: Interfaces between different components
4. **Deployment Strategy**: How to roll out across all systems
5. **Monitoring and Debugging**: How to troubleshoot across systems
6. **Performance Considerations**: Latency and throughput requirements

Create specifications that multiple development teams could execute independently.
```

### Context Management for Long Planning Sessions

#### Prompt 11: Iterative Planning with Context Preservation
```
# Use Build mode (default - enables file creation)
# This allows creating documentation and code templates

I'm planning a major feature upgrade that will require multiple planning sessions. Help me maintain context across these sessions:

**Feature**: E-commerce platform checkout optimization
**Planning Sessions**:
1. User experience flow planning
2. Payment integration technical design
3. Performance optimization strategy
4. Security and compliance requirements
5. Testing and rollout planning

For this session (Session 1 - UX Flow), plan the user experience while noting:

### When Planning is Complete

#### Prompt 12: Transition Preparation
```
I've completed the planning phase for [your feature]. Before switching to Build mode, help me prepare:

1. **Implementation Readiness Check**:
   - Are all requirements clearly defined?
   - Do I have concrete acceptance criteria?
   - Are technical approaches decided?

2. **Build Mode Preparation**:
   - What's the logical starting point for implementation?
   - Which components should be built first?
   - What context do I need to maintain for Build mode?

3. **Validation Strategy**:
   - How will I know each implementation step is correct?
   - What tests should I write as I build?
   - How do I verify the final implementation meets requirements?

Prepare me for an effective transition to Build mode implementation.
