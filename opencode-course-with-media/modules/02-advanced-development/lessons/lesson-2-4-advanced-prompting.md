## üéØ Real Project: Kubernetes Operator Development

We'll develop a **Kubernetes Operator for PostgreSQL** - a complex, production-grade project requiring advanced AI collaboration.

### Setup the Real Development Environment

```bash
# Clone Kubernetes sample operator for reference
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller.git
cd sample-controller

# Set up our PostgreSQL operator project
mkdir -p postgresql-operator/{cmd,pkg,config,api}

# Initialize OpenCode.ai for complex development
opencode
/init
```

**Why a Kubernetes Operator?**
- Complex domain requiring deep technical knowledge
- Multi-file, multi-package project structure
- Real production deployment concerns
- Integration with multiple external systems (Kubernetes API, PostgreSQL)
- Perfect for testing advanced prompting techniques

## üìù Advanced Technique 1: Context Layering and Management

### The Context Stack Pattern

#### Prompt 1: Establish Context Layers
```
I'm developing a Kubernetes PostgreSQL Operator. Help me establish layered context for this complex project:

**Context Layer 1 - Domain Knowledge**:
- Kubernetes operator patterns and best practices
- PostgreSQL cluster management requirements
- Go programming patterns for operators

**Context Layer 2 - Project Architecture**:
- Controller-runtime framework usage
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Reconciliation loop design patterns

**Context Layer 3 - Implementation Details**:
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Status reporting and observability
- Security and RBAC considerations

For each layer, provide:
1. Key concepts I need to understand
2. Common patterns and anti-patterns
3. Specific technical requirements
4. Integration points between layers

This will be my reference context for all subsequent development prompts.
```

**Advanced Technique**: This creates a hierarchical context that AI can reference throughout the project.

#### Prompt 2: Context Refresh and Expansion
```
Reference the context layers established in my previous prompt. Now expand Context Layer 2 (Project Architecture) with specific implementation details:

Based on the sample-controller repository structure, design the PostgreSQL operator architecture:

1. **Controller Design**:
   - PostgreSQLCluster custom resource specification
   - Reconciliation loop implementation strategy
   - Sub-controllers for different operational aspects

2. **Resource Management**:
   - StatefulSet management for PostgreSQL pods
   - Service creation for cluster access
   - PersistentVolume handling for data persistence

3. **Operational Logic**:
   - Cluster initialization and bootstrapping
   - Backup and recovery automation
   - Scaling and configuration updates

Keep the previous context layers active and reference them when relevant.
```

**Advanced Technique**: Explicit context management across multiple prompts in long development sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Technique 2: Iterative Development with Progressive Refinement

### The Spiral Development Pattern

#### Prompt 3: Development Spiral - Initial Implementation
```
/mode build

Using our established context layers, implement the PostgreSQL Operator foundation:

**Spiral 1 - Basic Structure** (implement now):
```go
// Basic CRD structure for PostgreSQLCluster
// Minimal controller with reconciliation skeleton
// Simple status reporting
```

**Spiral 2 - Core Functionality** (plan for next iteration):
- StatefulSet creation and management
- Service and endpoint management
- Basic error handling

**Spiral 3 - Advanced Features** (plan for future):
- Backup automation
- Monitoring integration
- High availability setup

Implement Spiral 1 completely, but structure the code to easily accommodate Spiral 2 and 3 additions. Include detailed comments explaining how each spiral will integrate.
```

#### Prompt 4: Development Spiral - Controlled Expansion
```
/mode build

Reference the Spiral 1 implementation from the previous prompt. Now implement Spiral 2 - Core Functionality:

**Build upon existing code**:
- Extend the controller to manage StatefulSets
- Add service creation and DNS management
- Implement comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff

**Maintain backward compatibility** with Spiral 1 structure
**Prepare integration points** for Spiral 3 features

While implementing, explain:
1. How each addition builds on the previous spiral
2. What design decisions support future spirals
3. Where you've added extension points for Spiral 3

Show the complete updated controller code with clear documentation of changes from Spiral 1.
```

**Advanced Technique**: Controlled, iterative development where each iteration builds systematically on the previous one.

## üß† Advanced Technique 3: Multi-Modal Problem Solving

### The Context-Switch Pattern

#### Prompt 5: Multi-Modal Analysis
```
I'm debugging a complex issue in my PostgreSQL Operator. The StatefulSet is created but pods remain in Pending state. 

Help me solve this using multi-modal analysis:

**Mode 1 - Code Analysis**:
# Using Build mode (enables all tools including file editing)
Analyze the controller code for StatefulSet creation logic. What could cause pods to remain in Pending state?

[After getting analysis, continue with:]

**Mode 2 - System Debugging**:
/mode build
Generate comprehensive debugging code that will:
1. Check node resources and scheduling constraints
2. Validate PersistentVolume provisioning
3. Verify RBAC permissions
4. Log detailed pod scheduling events

**Mode 3 - Solution Implementation**:
Based on the analysis and debugging findings, implement fixes for the most likely causes.

Keep context from all three modes to provide a comprehensive solution.
```

**Advanced Technique**: Using different OpenCode.ai modes systematically to approach complex problems from multiple angles.

### Context Preservation Across Modes

#### Prompt 6: Cross-Mode Context Management
```
Continuing from the multi-modal debugging session above:

**Context Summary from Previous Modes**:
- Plan mode identified potential PV provisioning issues
- Build mode generated debugging code that revealed RBAC permission gaps
- Current issue: ServiceAccount lacks necessary cluster-level permissions

**Now in Build Mode**:
/mode build

Fix the RBAC issues by implementing:
1. Updated ClusterRole with correct PostgreSQL operator permissions
2. Enhanced ServiceAccount configuration
3. Proper RoleBinding for the operator namespace
4. RBAC validation in the controller startup sequence

Reference the specific findings from our debugging session and ensure the fixes address the root causes we identified.
```

**Advanced Technique**: Explicitly maintaining context across mode switches for complex problem resolution.

## üéØ Advanced Technique 4: Sophisticated Code Generation Patterns

### The Specification-Driven Development Pattern

#### Prompt 7: Behavior-Driven Implementation
```
/mode build

Implement PostgreSQL high availability features using specification-driven development:

**Specification (Given-When-Then format)**:

```
GIVEN a PostgreSQL cluster with 3 replicas
WHEN the primary node fails
THEN a replica should be promoted to primary within 30 seconds
AND the cluster should maintain read/write availability
AND no data should be lost

GIVEN a PostgreSQL cluster during normal operation
WHEN a configuration change is requested
THEN the change should be applied via rolling update
AND read availability should be maintained throughout
AND write availability should have maximum 10-second downtime
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. Convert each specification into working Go code
2. Include comprehensive error handling for each scenario
3. Add metrics and observability for specification compliance
4. Implement integration tests that validate each specification

Show the complete implementation with clear mapping between specifications and code sections.
```

#### Prompt 8: Pattern-Based Code Generation
```
/mode build

Generate PostgreSQL operator code using established Kubernetes controller patterns:

**Pattern 1 - Resource Finalizer Management**:
```go
// Generate complete finalizer handling code that:
// - Prevents resource deletion during critical operations
// - Handles cleanup of external resources (cloud volumes, backups)
// - Manages graceful shutdown sequences
```

**Pattern 2 - Status Condition Management**:
```go
// Generate status management code that:
// - Implements standard Kubernetes condition types
// - Provides detailed progress reporting
// - Enables operational monitoring and alerting
```

**Pattern 3 - Event Generation and Logging**:
```go
// Generate comprehensive event and logging code that:
// - Records important operational events
// - Provides debugging information for troubleshooting
// - Enables operational observability
```

For each pattern, provide:
1. Complete, production-ready implementation
2. Integration points with the existing controller
3. Testing approach for the pattern
4. Operational usage examples
```

**Advanced Technique**: Using established patterns as templates for sophisticated code generation.

## üîß Advanced Technique 5: Error Handling and Recovery Strategies

### The Defensive Programming Pattern

#### Prompt 9: Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy
```
/mode build

Implement enterprise-grade error handling for the PostgreSQL Operator:

**Error Categories to Handle**:

1. **Transient Errors** (network timeouts, temporary resource unavailability)
2. **Configuration Errors** (invalid cluster specifications, resource conflicts)  
3. **Infrastructure Errors** (node failures, storage issues, network partitions)
4. **Application Errors** (PostgreSQL startup failures, corruption detection)

For each category, implement:

```go
// Error detection and classification
// Retry strategies with exponential backoff
// Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
// Graceful degradation when possible
// Comprehensive logging and metrics
// User-friendly status reporting
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Custom error types for each category
- Retry logic with appropriate backoff strategies
- Circuit breakers for external service calls
- Comprehensive error context and stack traces
- Structured logging for operational debugging
- Status updates that help operators understand issues

Show complete error handling implementation with real PostgreSQL operator scenarios.
```
