**Video Content**: [`videos/module-2/lesson-2-5-kernel-navigation.txt`](../../videos/module-2/lesson-2-5-kernel-navigation.txt)

**Real Impact**: 8-12 hours of manual exploration ‚Üí 45 seconds of guided discovery

## üèóÔ∏è Real Project: Linux Kernel Network Stack Enhancement

We'll work with the **Linux kernel networking subsystem** - one of the most complex codebases in existence.

### Setup the Real Massive Codebase

```bash
# Clone Linux kernel (5+ million lines of code)
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux

# Focus on networking subsystem (still 500,000+ lines)
cd net/

# Initialize OpenCode.ai for massive codebase navigation
opencode
/init
```

**Why Linux Kernel Networking?**
- 500,000+ lines in networking subsystem alone
- Complex interconnected modules and subsystems
- Real production code running on billions of devices
- Perfect example of codebase too large to understand without AI assistance
- Requires sophisticated context management and navigation strategies

## üìù Technique 1: Codebase Architecture Discovery

### The Top-Down Exploration Pattern

#### Prompt 1: High-Level Architecture Mapping
```
I need to understand the Linux kernel networking subsystem architecture to implement a new feature. Help me create a comprehensive architecture map:

**Analysis Request**:
1. **Core Subsystems**: Identify the main networking components (socket layer, protocol stacks, device drivers, etc.)
2. **Data Flow**: Trace how network packets flow through the system from hardware to application
3. **Key Data Structures**: Primary data structures that represent network connections, packets, and devices
4. **Entry Points**: Main functions where network processing begins
5. **Configuration and Control**: How the system is configured and controlled

**Scope**: Focus on the net/ directory structure but reference related kernel subsystems where relevant.

**Output Format**: 
- Hierarchical breakdown of subsystems
- Data flow diagrams (text-based)
- Key file locations for each component
- Integration points between subsystems

This will be my reference architecture for all subsequent development work.
```

**Technique**: Start with comprehensive architecture understanding before diving into specific code.

#### Prompt 2: Subsystem Dependency Analysis
```
Based on the architecture mapping, analyze the dependency relationships in the Linux networking stack:

**Dependency Analysis**:
1. **Hard Dependencies**: Which subsystems cannot function without others
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Components that depend on each other
3. **Optional Dependencies**: Features that enhance but aren't required by others
4. **External Dependencies**: Networking code's dependencies on other kernel subsystems

**For each major subsystem** (socket layer, TCP/IP stack, netfilter, etc.):
- **Depends on**: What it requires to function
- **Provides to**: What services it offers to other components  
- **Configuration**: How dependencies change based on kernel configuration
- **Initialization order**: Sequence requirements for system startup

**Critical for**: Understanding how changes propagate through the system and planning safe modification strategies.
```

**Technique**: Understanding dependency relationships prevents breaking changes in complex systems.

## üîç Technique 2: Focused Code Navigation

### The Context Window Management Pattern

#### Prompt 3: Intelligent Code Exploration
```
I want to add a new TCP congestion control algorithm to the Linux kernel. Guide me through focused navigation of the massive codebase:

**Navigation Strategy**:

2. **Example Analysis**: Examine 2-3 existing algorithms (like Cubic, BBR) to understand the implementation pattern
3. **Interface Definition**: Identify the exact interface/structure new algorithms must implement
4. **Integration Points**: Where the algorithm hooks into the TCP stack
5. **Testing Framework**: How congestion control algorithms are tested in the kernel

**Constraints**: 
- Focus only on congestion control subsystem to manage context
- Provide specific file paths and function names
- Include code snippets only for critical interface definitions
- Prioritize understanding over comprehensive coverage

**Outcome**: Clear roadmap for implementing a new congestion control algorithm without getting lost in the massive codebase.
```

#### Prompt 4: Context-Preserving Deep Dive
```
Continuing from the congestion control navigation above:

**Deep Dive into TCP Cubic Algorithm** (net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c):

**Preserve Context**: Reference the navigation strategy and interface definitions from the previous prompt.

**Detailed Analysis**:

2. **State Management**: What state Cubic maintains per connection
3. **Event Handling**: How it responds to packet loss, ACKs, and timeouts
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Specific optimizations for high-speed networks
5. **Configuration Parameters**: Tunable parameters and their effects

**Implementation Pattern Extraction**:
- Standard function signatures all algorithms must implement
- Common error handling patterns
- Integration with TCP state machine
- Performance measurement and debugging approaches

**Purpose**: Use Cubic as the template for implementing our new algorithm while maintaining context of the overall system architecture.
```

**Technique**: Layer detailed analysis on top of broad architectural understanding without losing context.
