# Lesson 2.6: Advanced Agent Orchestration & Multi-Agent Workflows

## 🎯 What You'll Actually Do

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows for enterprise development
- Implement agent handoff patterns for seamless task transitions
- Build intelligent agent selection and routing systems
- Create self-organizing agent teams that adapt to project requirements

## 🤖 Advanced Agent Orchestration Concepts

### Multi-Agent System Architecture

OpenCode.ai's agent system supports sophisticated coordination patterns:

- **Sequential Workflows**: Agents pass work through a pipeline
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Hierarchical Delegation**: Master agents coordinate sub-agent teams
- **Adaptive Routing**: Intelligent agent selection based on context and performance

### Enterprise Agent Patterns

#### 1. Development Pipeline Orchestration
```
Architect Agent → Security Auditor → Implementation Team → Testing Team → Documentation Team
```

#### 2. Code Review Assembly Line
```
Static Analysis Agent → Security Scanner → Performance Auditor → Human Review Coordinator
```

#### 3. Emergency Response Team
```
Issue Classifier → Specialized Diagnostic Agents → Fix Implementation → Validation Team
```

```

## 🔧 Step 2: Implement Intelligent Agent Routing

### Context-Aware Agent Selection

Create a smart routing system that selects agents based on context:

```bash
cat > .opencode/scripts/smart-agent-router.js << 'EOF'
class SmartAgentRouter {
  constructor() {
    this.agentCapabilities = {
      'security-auditor': ['security', 'vulnerability', 'auth', 'encryption'],
      'performance-optimizer': ['performance', 'optimization', 'bottleneck', 'scaling'],
      'code-reviewer': ['code-quality', 'best-practices', 'maintainability'],
      'test-engineer': ['testing', 'validation', 'coverage', 'automation'],
      'doc-writer': ['documentation', 'api-docs', 'readme', 'guides'],
      'api-developer': ['api', 'endpoints', 'rest', 'graphql'],
      'database-expert': ['database', 'sql', 'query', 'schema', 'migration'],
      'frontend-specialist': ['ui', 'react', 'vue', 'angular', 'css'],
      'devops-engineer': ['deployment', 'ci-cd', 'docker', 'kubernetes']
    };
    
    this.performanceHistory = {};
    this.currentWorkload = {};
  }

  // Analyze task and return best agent match
  selectAgent(taskDescription, context = {}) {
    const keywords = this.extractKeywords(taskDescription.toLowerCase());
    const scores = {};
    
    // Score agents based on keyword matches
    for (const [agent, capabilities] of Object.entries(this.agentCapabilities)) {
      scores[agent] = this.calculateCapabilityScore(keywords, capabilities);
    }
    
    // Adjust scores based on performance history
    this.adjustForPerformance(scores);
    
    // Adjust scores based on current workload
    this.adjustForWorkload(scores);
    
    // Return best match
    const bestAgent = Object.keys(scores).reduce((a, b) => 
      scores[a] > scores[b] ? a : b
    );
    
    return {
      agent: bestAgent,
      confidence: scores[bestAgent],
      reasoning: this.explainSelection(bestAgent, taskDescription, scores)
    };
  }

  // Extract relevant keywords from task description
  extractKeywords(text) {
    const allKeywords = Object.values(this.agentCapabilities).flat();
    return allKeywords.filter(keyword => text.includes(keyword));
  }

  // Calculate capability match score
  calculateCapabilityScore(keywords, capabilities) {
    const matches = keywords.filter(keyword => capabilities.includes(keyword));
    return matches.length / capabilities.length;
  }

  // Adjust scores based on historical performance
  adjustForPerformance(scores) {
    for (const agent in scores) {
      const history = this.performanceHistory[agent];
      if (history) {
        const performanceMultiplier = history.successRate * history.avgQuality;
        scores[agent] *= performanceMultiplier;
      }
    }
  }

  // Adjust scores based on current workload
  adjustForWorkload(scores) {
    for (const agent in scores) {
      const workload = this.currentWorkload[agent] || 0;
      scores[agent] *= (1 - workload * 0.3); // Reduce score for busy agents
    }
  }

  // Explain why this agent was selected
  explainSelection(agent, task, scores) {
    return `Selected ${agent} for task "${task}" with confidence ${scores[agent].toFixed(2)}. ` +
           `This agent has the best capability match and availability for this type of work.`;
  }
}

module.exports = SmartAgentRouter;
EOF
```

### Use the Smart Router in OpenCode.ai

```bash
# Create wrapper script for intelligent agent selection
cat > .opencode/scripts/smart-agent.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

TASK_DESCRIPTION="$1"
CONTEXT_FILE="$2"

# Call the smart router
SELECTED_AGENT=$(node .opencode/scripts/smart-agent-router.js "$TASK_DESCRIPTION" "$CONTEXT_FILE")

echo "🤖 Smart Agent Router selected: $SELECTED_AGENT"
echo "📋 Task: $TASK_DESCRIPTION"

# Switch to the selected agent in OpenCode.ai
opencode agent switch "$SELECTED_AGENT"
EOF

chmod +x .opencode/scripts/smart-agent.sh
```

# Continue through all phases...
```

## 🎯 Step 4: Advanced Agent Coordination Patterns

### Agent Handoff Protocol

Implement smooth handoffs between agents with context preservation:

```bash
cat > .opencode/agents/handoff-coordinator.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "handoff-coordinator", 
  "description": "Manages context and state during agent handoffs to ensure seamless workflow transitions",

  "maxTokens": 5000,
  "systemPrompt": "You are a handoff coordinator that manages seamless transitions between agents. Your responsibilities:\n1. Capture and preserve context from the current agent's work\n2. Summarize key decisions, findings, and outputs\n3. Identify dependencies and requirements for the next agent\n4. Format handoff information for optimal next-agent understanding\n5. Track progress against overall workflow objectives\n6. Escalate issues that require human intervention\n\nAlways provide clear, actionable handoff summaries with complete context preservation.",
  "tools": ["read", "write"],
  "temperature": 0.2
}
EOF
```

### Use Handoff Coordination

```bash
# When transitioning from architect to implementation
/agent handoff-coordinator
/ask "Coordinate handoff from system-architect to api-developer. The architect has completed the authentication system design. Summarize key architectural decisions, dependencies, and requirements for the implementation team."

# Switch to next agent with full context
/agent api-developer
/ask "I'm receiving a handoff from the system architect. Please implement the JWT authentication system based on the architecture specifications and requirements provided by the handoff coordinator."
```

### Error Recovery and Fallback Patterns
