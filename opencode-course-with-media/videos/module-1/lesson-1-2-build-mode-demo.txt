# Video Content: Build Mode vs Plan Mode (60 seconds)

## Simulated Video Transcript & Screen Content

[00:00] NARRATOR: "Critical difference: Build mode vs Plan mode"

[00:05] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
> opencode
ðŸš€ OpenCode.ai ready
Current mode: Plan (read-only)
>
```

[00:08] NARRATOR: "Plan mode - read only, cannot edit files"
[00:10] TYPED: `/mode plan`
[00:12] TYPED: `Create a simple Python function that adds two numbers`

[00:15] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
ðŸ¤– I can help you design a Python function. Here's what it would look like:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return a + b

# Example usage:
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

ðŸ’¡ Note: I'm in Plan mode, so I can only suggest code. 
   I cannot create or modify files.
```

[00:20] NARRATOR: "Build mode - can actually create and edit files"
[00:22] TYPED: `/mode build`
[00:24] TYPED: `Create a simple Python function that adds two numbers in hello.py`

[00:27] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
ðŸ¤– I'll create the Python function in a new file for you.

Creating file: hello.py

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return a + b

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")
```

âœ“ File created: hello.py
âœ“ Function implemented with example usage
âœ“ Ready to run: python hello.py
```

[00:35] NARRATOR: "See the difference? Build mode created the actual file"
[00:37] TYPED: `ls -la hello.py`

[00:39] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 234 Dec 15 10:30 hello.py
```

[00:41] TYPED: `cat hello.py`

[00:43] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return a + b

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")
```

[00:45] TYPED: `python hello.py`

[00:47] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
5 + 3 = 8
```

[00:50] NARRATOR: "For real development, always use Build mode"

[00:52] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
> /mode build
âœ“ Build mode activated
âœ“ File editing enabled
âœ“ Full development capabilities active

Pro tip: Build mode is default for experienced developers
```

## Key Learning Points Demonstrated:
âœ“ Plan mode limitations (read-only)
âœ“ Build mode capabilities (file creation)
âœ“ Actual file creation and execution
âœ“ Why Build mode is essential for development
âœ“ Real working code output
