🤖 Analyzing FastAPI's architecture...

The 3 main architectural components of FastAPI are:

1. **FastAPI Class (Core Routing)**
   - Location: fastapi/applications.py
   - Purpose: Main application class, handles routing and middleware
   - Key methods: add_api_route(), include_router()

2. **Dependency Injection System**  
   - Location: fastapi/dependencies/
   - Purpose: Manages request dependencies and parameter validation
   - Key files: utils.py, models.py

3. **Request/Response Handling**
   - Location: fastapi/routing.py
   - Purpose: HTTP request processing and response serialization
   - Integration: Works with Starlette's ASGI foundation

These components work together to provide the fast, automatic API documentation
and type-safe development experience FastAPI is known for.

[00:30] TYPED: `Show me how routing works`

[00:33] SCREEN SHOWS:
```
🤖 Let me show you FastAPI's routing mechanism:

Key File: fastapi/routing.py (lines 1-50)

```python
class APIRoute(Route):
    def __init__(
        self,
        path: str,
        endpoint: Callable[..., Any],
        *,
        response_model: Any = Default(None),
        status_code: Optional[int] = None,
        # ...more parameters
    ):
        # Route initialization logic
```

The routing works by:
1. Decorator (@app.get, @app.post) creates APIRoute instances
2. Routes are registered in the FastAPI application
3. Request matching happens in route_handler()
4. Dependencies are resolved automatically
5. Response is serialized based on response_model

Example flow: HTTP Request → Route Match → Dependency Resolution → 
Endpoint Execution → Response Serialization
```
