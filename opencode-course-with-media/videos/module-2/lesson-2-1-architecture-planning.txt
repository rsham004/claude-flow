# Video: Architecture Planning with Build Mode (1 minute)

## Scenario: Django Oscar E-commerce Architecture Planning

**[0:00-0:10] Setup Context**
Developer: "I need to design a microservices architecture for this 180,000 line Django Oscar e-commerce platform. Let me use OpenCode.ai's Build mode for this complex planning task."

Terminal: `opencode`
OpenCode: "OpenCode.ai ready. You're in Build mode - I can create and modify files for your architecture planning."

**[0:10-0:25] AI-Powered Architecture Analysis**
Developer: "Analyze the Django Oscar codebase and design a microservices split strategy"

OpenCode: *Scanning 180k lines*
"Analyzing Oscar architecture... Found 12 major domains:
- Customer management (oscar/apps/customer/)  
- Product catalog (oscar/apps/catalogue/)
- Order processing (oscar/apps/order/)
- Payment handling (oscar/apps/payment/)
- Inventory management (oscar/apps/partner/)

Recommending 5 core microservices based on domain boundaries and data coupling analysis."

**[0:25-0:45] Real Architecture Design**
OpenCode: *Creates architecture files*
"Creating architecture documents:
- microservices-architecture.md (service boundaries)
- api-contracts.yaml (service interfaces)  
- data-migration-plan.md (database splitting strategy)
- deployment-architecture.yaml (infrastructure design)"

Developer: "Show me the service boundary recommendations"

OpenCode: "Customer Service: 15k lines (user accounts, profiles, addresses)
Catalog Service: 25k lines (products, categories, search)
Order Service: 20k lines (cart, checkout, order processing)
Payment Service: 8k lines (payment methods, transactions)
Inventory Service: 12k lines (stock, warehouses, fulfillment)"

**[0:45-0:60] Architecture Validation**
OpenCode: "Architecture analysis complete. Key benefits:
- 67% reduction in service coupling
- Independent deployment capability
- Clear API boundaries with OpenAPI specs
- Database per service pattern implementation
- Event-driven communication design"

Developer: "This AI-powered architecture planning just saved me 3 days of manual analysis and gave me a production-ready microservices design."

## Key Learning Points:
1. **Build Mode for Architecture**: Can create planning documents and diagrams
2. **Large Codebase Analysis**: AI processes 180k lines to identify service boundaries  
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Automatic identification of business domains
4. **Production-Ready Output**: Complete architecture documentation with implementation plans

## Real Impact: 
- **Manual Analysis**: 2-3 days of senior architect time
- **AI-Assisted Planning**: 30 minutes with comprehensive documentation
- **Quality**: Professional-grade architecture with industry best practices
