# Video: Advanced Agent Orchestration - Multi-Agent Development (1 minute)

## Scenario: Complex Feature Development with Agent Team

**[0:00-0:12] Multi-Agent Setup**
Developer: "I need to implement real-time collaborative editing for a document platform. This requires multiple specialized agents working together."

Terminal: `opencode`
Developer: "Setting up agent orchestration for complex feature development"

Commands:
```bash
/agent system-architect
/agent performance-optimizer  
/agent security-auditor
/agent test-engineer
```

**[0:12-0:30] Coordinated Architecture Planning**
Developer to System Architect: "Design the real-time collaboration architecture with WebSocket, operational transforms, and conflict resolution"

System Architect: "Architecture designed:
- WebSocket server with Redis pub/sub for scaling
- Operational Transform algorithm for conflict-free editing
- Document state synchronization with vector clocks
- Authentication middleware with JWT tokens"

Developer to Security Auditor: "Review this architecture for security vulnerabilities"

Security Auditor: "Security analysis complete:
- Add rate limiting per user (100 ops/minute)
- Implement document access control with room-based permissions  
- Sanitize all document operations to prevent XSS injection
- Add audit logging for compliance requirements"

**[0:30-0:48] Parallel Implementation**
Developer to Performance Optimizer: "Optimize the operational transform algorithm for 1000+ concurrent users"

Performance Optimizer: "Performance optimizations:
- Implement efficient tree-based OT algorithm (O(log n))
- Add operation batching to reduce WebSocket overhead
- Use Redis clustering for horizontal scaling
- Implement client-side operation queuing and compression"

Developer to Test Engineer: "Create comprehensive test suite for the collaboration system"

Test Engineer: "Test suite implemented:
- Unit tests for OT algorithm with 500+ conflict scenarios
- Integration tests for WebSocket message handling  
- Load tests simulating 1000 concurrent editors
- End-to-end tests for real-time synchronization accuracy"

**[0:48-0:60] Agent Coordination Results**
Developer: "Agent orchestration results:"

System Display:
```
âœ… Architecture: Scalable real-time collaboration system
âœ… Security: Enterprise-grade access control and audit logging  
âœ… Performance: Sub-50ms operation latency at scale
âœ… Quality: 96% test coverage with comprehensive scenarios
ðŸš€ Implementation: Production-ready in 4 hours vs 2-3 weeks manually
```

Developer: "Multi-agent orchestration just delivered a complete, production-ready real-time collaboration system with professional architecture, security, performance optimization, and comprehensive testing."

## Key Learning Points:
1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent focuses on their domain expertise
2. **Coordinated Planning**: Agents build on each other's work systematically  
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple aspects developed simultaneously
4. **Quality Integration**: Architecture, security, performance, and testing coordinated from start

## Real Impact:
- **Traditional Development**: 2-3 weeks with 4-person team
- **Agent Orchestration**: 4 hours with AI-coordinated development
- **Quality**: Enterprise-grade system meeting all professional standards  
- **Coordination**: Seamless integration of architecture, security, performance, and testing concerns
